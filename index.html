  <h1>The Architecture Beyond Capitalism (ABC) Project</h1>
  <p>
    ABC School 2023 is a place for dreamers and pragmatists alike. We welcome those with interests in and ideas for—however small, however fantastical—working out what it means to learn and practice architecture more collectively, more ethically and more sustainably through a lens of Future Belonging, a concept that emphasizes collective action and speculative futurism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future Belonging holds space to:
   <ul>
      <li>find global allies for change-making projects and movements.</li>
      <li>test frameworks, formats and strategies for building better and lasting collective momentum;</li>
      <li>layout visions for architecture beyond capitalism—including alternatives and improvements to the status quo;</li>
      <li>develop disciplinary language and practices that are more open and inclusive;</li>
      <li>humanize the expectations and outcomes of design processes;</li>
      <li>explore and develop together in a messy process</li>
   </ul>
   This space is free, inclusive, supportive and open to all:  students, educators, practitioners, constructors, and anyone interested in or passionate about affecting change. We invite individuals and collectives working to affect change in spatial production; individuals and collectives working with people, groups, communities or organisations to bring about an equitable tomorrow; individuals or collectives working with new organizational techniques for leveraging influence. We would like to learn from the experiences of others meeting this challenge, and foster a space to support those just starting out.
