abstract:
  short: "​The Night School (TNS) is running two live, in person events as part of The Architecture Lobby's online ABC 2022. This event, Community After Collapse will take an online workshop developed by Sadia Mounata in Berlin, and adapt it to Tāmaki Makaurau. Participants will be asked to consider in groups a community they feel is is on the verge of of collapsing or is vulnerable to any kind of climatic, environmental, political, social or technological threats or dissonance. They will then strategise and propose through graphs, patterns, maps and drawings their response as professionals through who, what, where, and how analyses. Capacities to coordinate diversity, to incorporate various patterns, to make instant decisions in the multiplicity, to makeshift in the real time, might reveal propositions for an alternative approach to the practicing and educating of future architects."
