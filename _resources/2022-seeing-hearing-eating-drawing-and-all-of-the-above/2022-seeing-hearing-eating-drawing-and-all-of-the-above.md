abstract:
  short: "â€‹This workshop will introduce a survey of methods around embodied design pedagogies on situating sites as a location, as a classroom, a political and lived knowledge through fieldwork, oral storytelling, and making. We will look at guerrilla tactics of telling and maintaining stories through oral traditions, comics, picture books, and artifacts. Attendees will learn and understand how design ways of inquiry, imaginaries, and creative acts come to embody oppressive ideologies."
