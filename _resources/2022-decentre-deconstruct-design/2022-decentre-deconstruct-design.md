abstract:
  short: "The workshop Decenter - Deconstruct - Design(?) is divided into three parts each exploring and addressing disciplinary, ideological and spatial questions through the engagement of participants in mapping architectural curricula, collective critical thinking and design-driven strategizing, and aims to assess alternative modes of architectural education and production beyond conventional capitalist constructs."
  long:

learning-outcomes:
