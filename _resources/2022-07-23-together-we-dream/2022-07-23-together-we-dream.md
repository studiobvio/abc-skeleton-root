abstract:
  short: "​Our workshop is an act of engaging the self (no, not that Self) where you must design, draw, detail your utopian biography. Our work will explore individual ambitions as we attempt to author our professional lives and explore methods of alternative practice that have existed in the past and today. Prior to meeting, we ask that you complete your biography according to the guiding questions set forth in our workshop assignment plan. Additional, optional readings can also be found in the library."

learning-outcomes:

prerequisites: "​Design, draw, detail your utopian biography - the you of 2030, unrestricted by realities. If you choose to represent your utopian biography through image, please provide accompanying text. We suggest a word limit between 250-750 words, even fewer if you’re supplementing with image(s). Let your creative juices flow, pick your medium of choice, and have fun!"
