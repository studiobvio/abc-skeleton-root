abstract:
  short: "​FREE STUDIO envisions the academic design studio setting as an interdisciplinary space that elevates freedom of creative endeavor and a multiplicity of approaches. ​FREE STUDIO envisions the academic design studio setting as an interdisciplinary space that elevates freedom of creative endeavor and a multiplicity of approaches. FREE STUDIO connects the studio with abstract visual art, abolitionist practice, futurism and liberatory music concepts.The work of author/artist Patrisse Cullors, architect Sumayya Vally and Detroit Techno artists Underground Resistance and Jeff Mills, and others will be discussed. Opening up new ways of thinking [both from within and from without ourselves] can potentially lead to material changes in our bodies and our environment. FREE STUDIO is liberated from the constraints of grading, administrative systems, client concerns, programmatic limitations and prescribed outcomes. FREE STUDIO allows the flow of ideas from our pasts/heritages/cultures, from our tenuous yet precious present and from the future selves that we are becoming."
