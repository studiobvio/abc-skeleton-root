Will is a PhD Researcher and Teaching Fellow at the Carnegie Mellon School of Design.

Will strives to design and implement transdisciplinary strategies to empower and inspire communities (human and non-human) to cooperatively imagine and build radically inclusive, equitable, resilient, and prosperous futures. His research and work has taken many forms: web applications, data analysis/visualization, geospatial mapping, architectural designs, documentary films, science fiction stories, labor activism, policy design, video games, teaching, and parenting. With a diverse background in economics, geography, documentary media, architecture, urban planning, and data science, Will works collaboratively with a broad range of teams to design and deploy tools that evolve our shared environments, be they physical or digital, imaginary or real, for the better.

Will holds a Bachelors of Arts in International Studies in Economics from Middlebury College in Vermont as well as a Masters of Architecture and a Masters of Science in Conservation from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He has worked at award winning architecture and urban design firms including KLM Arquitectos in Buenos Aires, WXY in New York, and RNL (now Stantec) in Denver. He is a co-founding principal of Studiobvio, a Denver based architecture and urban research firm. Will has presented his research and creative work at institutions including the American Institute of Architects, American Planning Association, Rocky Mountain Land Institute at University of Denver, Yale School of Architecture, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, Harvard University's Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, the Noguchi Museum in Queens, the Architectural Club - Chicago, and the Architectural League of New York.

Will is also a founding member of the Architecture Lobby, a grassroots organization of architectural workers – architects, landscape architects, planners, designers, students, and others – advocating for just labor practices and an equitable built environment, where he dedicates his time collaborating with an international group of dedicated volunteers to develop an Architecture Beyond Capitalism and cooperative modes of design practice.
