<h3>Step 1: Downloading, installing, and learning Zettlr.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to
    <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/download"> the Zettlr download page</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Based on you operating system (MAC, Windows, Linux, etc), select the
    appropriate button below the respective icons to install the installer
    package.
  </li>
  <li>
    As the download begins, a pop-up window tilted "Next steps" should appear
    with suggestions and links for learning how (and why) to use Zettlr. There
    is also a series of embedded videos. We highly recommend that you take some
    time to review and bookmark this material.
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigate to your downloads folder and double click on the Zettlr download
    package to begin the installation set-up prompts. Default setting will be
    appropriate for most users.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be sure that the "Run Zettlr" box is checked when click "Finish" on the
    final intallation window, and the Zettlr application will open
    automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
    To further aid your learning how to use Zettlr, the installation includes a
    folder that contains several example files that include more information on
    advanced functionality in Zettlr. You do not need to know these advanced
    features, however, we recommned you this preloaded folder (what Zettlr calls
    a workspace) to become familiar with the user inferace and some of the
    methods for formatting.
