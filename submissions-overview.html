  <h1>Resource Submission Process</h1>
  With the ABC Hub (the Hub) we are collectively building a platform to connect
  people and places with ideas and actions. While the resources and community
  hosted here are open to all, what makes the Hub an engine for change is active
  participation. Participation can take many forms. Most essential to the growth
  of the Hub are three different ways to contribute directly to the content of
  the Hub.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add a profile page of your self and/or your organization. This step is
      required before you submit a resource or blog post.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a resource page the provides the Hub community with tools and
      techniques for enacting change.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a blog post that generate fruitful dialogue or brings awareness to a
      particular event or action.
    </li>
  </ul>
  This page provides you with the steps and resources you need to submit this
  content for inclusion on the the Hub website. To submit your content, you will
  need a computer/tablet/phone with internet access as a simple text editor.
  Below we wll provide you with a step by step guide that uses Zettlr, our
  recommended Free and Open Source Software for document editing. Following
  these steps will simplify and expedite your submission process and also ensure
  that your content renders in a predicable way on the Hub website.

  <h3>Step 1: Downloading, installing, and learning Zettlr.</h3>

      appropriate button below the respective icons to install the installer
      package.
    </li>
    <li>
      As the download begins, a pop-up window tilted "Next steps" should appear
      with suggestions and links for learning how (and why) to use Zettlr. There
      is also a series of embedded videos. We highly recommend that you take
      some time to review and bookmark this material.

      Navigate to your downloads folder and double click on the Zettlr download
      package to begin the installation set-up prompts. Default setting will be

      final intallation window, and the Zettlr application will open

    <li>
      To further aid your learning how to use Zettlr, the installation includes
      a folder that contains several example files that include more information
      on advanced functionality in Zettlr. You do not need to know these
      advanced features, however, we recommned you this preloaded folder (what
      Zettlr calls a workspace) to become familiar with the user inferace and
      some of the methods for formatting.
