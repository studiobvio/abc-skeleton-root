_Unlike Thomas More's utopian representations, above in a woodcut illustration from a 1518 print of his book "Utopia", we focus on a process and believe that utopias could be anyplace [^Fig. 2]_

We encourage footnoting to provide extra context to your writing when appropriate. You manually add note references within square brackets with the reference preceded by a carrot ("^"). The footnote reference will look like this `[^Your Text]`. To complete the footnote, add the same reference followed by a colon `[^Your Text]:` and your footnote text at the end of your document. The footnote will automatically by hyperlinked so that the reader can got to the footnote and immediately return to where the footnote is referenced in the main text [^1]. You will note that these references are technically "endnotes" as they appear at the bottom of the entire document. If your resource is printed via pdf, however, all your footnotes will be added as proper footnotes at the end of each page.
