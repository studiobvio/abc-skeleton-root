## WYSIWYM + Markdown: Focus on meaning and accessibility

Popular word-processing software are based on the WYSIWYG or "What You See Is What You Get" model which represents your writting in a final formatted manner (including fonts, styling etc.) while you are editing. While this may be an effective approach for some contexts, it also has limitations. Alternative documment drafting models exist that are increasing in popularity and functionality in todays increasingly digital publishing landscape. One of the most popular alternative model is the WYSIWYM.

WYSIWYM stands for "What You See Is What You Mean." It is an important idea in document editing and formatting, emphasizing the separation of content and presentation. Unlike WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors that display content exactly as it will appear, WYSIWYM focuses on representing the intended meaning of the content rather than its visual representation.

The significance of WYSIWYM lies in its ability to provide greater control and flexibility over document formatting. By separating content and presentation, it allows users to focus on the structure and semantics of their documents, rather than getting distracted by visual details. WYSIWYM systems interpret the document's structure and apply appropriate formatting based on predefined rules or user-defined stylesheets. This approach promotes consistency, simplifies editing, and ensures the document's meaning is preserved across different platforms or mediums.

To this end, we will ask that contributors to the ABC Repository embrace the WYSIWYM paradigm for generating and sharing content. Specifically we will use Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that follows the principles of WYSIWYM. It offers a simplified syntax for formatting text, allowing users to add elements like headers, lists, links, and emphasis without delving into complex formatting options. Markdown is straightforward to learn and use, making it accessible to a wide range of users, including those who might be hesitant to try something new.

Here are a few reasons why people should consider using Markdown, even if they are initially apprehensive:

1. **Simplicity:** Markdown's syntax is intuitive and easy to grasp, requiring minimal effort to learn. It uses simple symbols and characters to represent formatting elements, which reduces the cognitive load associated with more complex formatting options.

2. **Portability:** Markdown files are plain text files with minimal formatting, making them highly portable. They can be opened and edited with a wide range of text editors, and the resulting formatted documents can be converted to various formats such as HTML, PDF, or rich text.

3. **Focus on content:** Markdown's emphasis on content over presentation encourages users to concentrate on the information they want to convey rather than getting bogged down in visual details. This approach promotes clear and structured writing.

4. **Version control and collaboration:** Markdown files are human-readable, making them ideal for version control systems like Git. Collaborative writing and editing are made easier with Markdown, as changes can be easily tracked and merged.

5. **Extensibility:** Markdown's simplicity doesn't limit its functionality. It supports the use of HTML within the document, enabling more advanced formatting options when needed. Additionally, there are numerous tools and converters available that enhance Markdown's capabilities, providing additional features or customized output formats.

Whether or not your've heard of
Markdown before, please take a moment to read a recent blog post by Max
Lytvyak title [Markdown for Non-developers: How Writers, Educators, and Researchers
Can Benefit](https://maxlytvyak.com/markdown-editors-non-developers/)
that speaks to it's strengths as a tool to help the ABC Community connect,
express, share, and evolve strategies for societal change.

## Learning Markdown

introduction, try a short tutorial [here](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)
and practice what you've learned [here](<https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/?text=%23%23%20Try%20CommonMark%0A%0AYou%20can%20try%20CommonMark%20here.%20%20This%20dingus%20is%20powered%20by%0A%5Bcommonmark.js%5D(https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcommonmark%2Fcommonmark.js)%2C%20the%0AJavaScript%20reference%20implementation.%0A%0A1.%20item%20one%0A2.%20item%20two%0A%20%20%20-%20sublist%0A%20%20%20-%20sublist%0A%0A>)

We recommend [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com) because it is a free and
open-source software with an active community of contributors and it has
an academic focus, availability on most operating system (Windows, Mac,
Linux, etc). Zettlr has robust [documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/) as well as [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ_tpVtLX8k&list=PL2ydvDwV-1u5ncnkxQWZhbHQdwpY2fx5f)

To make resources in the ABC Repository as widely accessible and extensible as
possible to our community, we require all resources conform to the submission
guidelines outline below. For each resource you will upload a single folder
with a primary text file and any supplemental media files in ato our
open-source repository which is hosted on GitHub. The repository content will
be rendered as a searchable website. While you may draft your resource
material an any format you wish, your final submission will be a MarkDown
document. We understand that there may be a learning curve for most
contributors who typically use other proprietary or add-funded tools like
Microsoft Word, Mac Pages, or Google Docs. We do not want to constrain your
creative process in any way, however you will be required to convert
non-Markdown documents into a text Markdown file with appropriate formatting
to submit your resource for inclusion in the ABC repository. We believe that
the extra effort to make this translation into a lightweight, structured
format will greatly increase the accessibility of your contributions and
increase our collective power to make change. To simplify this translation
process, we recommend drafting your submission directly in a Markdown editor
(there are many paid and free options available).You can also download a zip file with the required folder
structure and an example submission included below. A key feature of Markdown
documents is the ability to store metadata about the document (call YAML
Frontmatter) at the beginning of the document that can be used to provide
additional content about the document in a structured manner. To ensure that
all submisisons include this vital metadata, we have provided a form below
that will automatically generate most of the essential Frontmatter to be
included at the beginning of the Markdown file you will submit.
