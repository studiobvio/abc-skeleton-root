A "workers cooperative" refers to a business model that is owned and governed by its workers. A cooperative is a type of organization where workers share in the profits and decision-making of the business, rather than having those benefits and decisions made by a small group of owners or shareholders.

In a workers coop, each worker has an equal say in how the business is run, regardless of their position or level of expertise. This creates a more democratic and participatory workplace, where workers have a greater sense of ownership and control over their work and their future.

Cooperatives are important because they prioritize the well-being of workers and communities over profit. They provide an alternative to traditional capitalist models, which often prioritize the interests of owners and shareholders over workers and communities. By creating a more equitable and democratic workplace, workers cooperatives can help to reduce economic inequality and create a more just and sustainable economy.

Workers cooperatives can also have positive social and environmental impacts. By empowering workers and creating a more democratic workplace, cooperatives can help to strengthen local communities and support social and environmental initiatives. Additionally, because workers in a cooperative have a direct stake in the success of the business, they may be more motivated to prioritize environmental sustainability and social responsibility.
