The term "living systems" refers to complex systems found in nature that are characterized by the ability to self-organize, self-regulate, and adapt to changing environments. Examples of living systems include ecosystems, organisms, and even social systems like communities and societies.

Living systems are distinguished from non-living systems by their ability to maintain a state of dynamic equilibrium, despite changes in the environment. This is achieved through processes like feedback loops, where the system responds to changes in the environment by adjusting its behavior or structure to maintain stability.

Living systems are also characterized by their ability to evolve and adapt over time. This is achieved through processes like natural selection, where genetic mutations that confer an advantage in a given environment are more likely to be passed on to future generations.

Living systems are often studied by scientists and researchers in fields like biology, ecology, and systems theory. By understanding the principles that govern living systems, researchers can gain insights into how to design more sustainable and resilient human systems, such as cities and communities.

Overall, the concept of living systems emphasizes the interconnectedness and complexity of the natural world, and the importance of understanding and working with these systems in order to create more sustainable and resilient societies.
