The term "social ecology" refers to a holistic approach to understanding and addressing social and ecological issues. Social ecology recognizes that social and ecological problems are deeply interconnected and cannot be fully understood or solved in isolation from each other.

At its core, social ecology is concerned with creating sustainable and just communities that prioritize the well-being of both people and the environment. This involves reimagining and transforming the relationships between humans and their natural environment, as well as the relationships between different human communities.

Social ecology draws on a variety of disciplines, including ecology, sociology, economics, and political theory. It emphasizes the importance of community-led solutions and democratic decision-making processes, as well as the need for a more equitable distribution of resources and power.

One of the key principles of social ecology is the idea of "social metabolism," which refers to the ways in which human societies interact with and transform the natural environment. Social ecology recognizes that unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and production are a major driver of social and ecological problems, and that transforming these patterns is essential for creating more sustainable and just communities.

Overall, social ecology is a way of thinking about and addressing social and ecological issues that recognizes the interconnectedness of these problems and seeks to create more sustainable and just communities. By prioritizing community-led solutions and democratic decision-making processes, social ecology offers a path towards a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
