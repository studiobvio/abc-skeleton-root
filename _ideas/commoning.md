"Commoning" refers to the process of communities coming together to manage and share resources. This means that people work together to take care of things that belong to everyone, like parks, libraries, and community gardens.

When people "common" resources, they make decisions together about how to use and care for them. This helps to create a more democratic and participatory community where everyone has a say in how things are run.

For example, a group of neighbors might decide to start a community garden on a piece of unused land. They would work together to plant and maintain the garden, and they would make decisions together about how to use the fruits and vegetables that they grow. This would be an example of commoning.

Commoning is important because it helps to build strong and resilient communities. By working together to manage resources, people can develop a sense of shared ownership and responsibility for the well-being of their community. It also helps to promote more sustainable and equitable use of resources, which can benefit everyone in the long run.
