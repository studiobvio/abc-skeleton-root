"Capitalism" is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution are owned and controlled by private individuals and corporations, who operate for profit in a competitive market. In capitalism, the goal is to accumulate capital, or wealth, through the production and sale of goods and services.

The driving force of capitalism is the profit motive, which incentivizes individuals and companies to seek maximum financial gain by minimizing costs and maximizing revenue. This can create a dynamic in which workers are paid as little as possible, and environmental and social costs may be externalized in order to boost profits.

Capitalism is characterized by a system of wage labor, in which workers sell their labor in exchange for wages, which are typically determined by market forces rather than the actual value produced by the worker. This can lead to exploitation of workers, as they may not receive a fair share of the value that they create through their labor.

Critics of capitalism argue that it can perpetuate economic inequality and social injustice, as wealth and power are concentrated in the hands of a small minority of capitalists. They also argue that capitalism may have negative effects on the environment, as the profit motive can incentivize the exploitation of natural resources without regard for long-term sustainability.

Overall, the concept of capitalism emphasizes the importance of private ownership and market competition in economic decision-making, and is a key factor in debates around economic policy and social justice.
