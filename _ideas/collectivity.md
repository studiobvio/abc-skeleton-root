The term "collectivity" refers to the idea of working together as a group towards a common goal or purpose. It is the act of coming together to create something that is greater than what individuals can accomplish on their own.

Collectivity is often associated with the idea of collaboration, where individuals contribute their unique skills, knowledge, and perspectives to a shared project or initiative. This can lead to more diverse and innovative outcomes, as well as a sense of shared ownership and responsibility.

In the context of design and community efforts, collectivity can be a powerful tool for creating more democratic and participatory design practices. By bringing together diverse voices and perspectives, and working collaboratively towards a shared vision, we can create more inclusive and equitable outcomes that reflect the needs and desires of the community as a whole.

Overall, collectivity is an important concept for understanding the power of working together towards a common goal, and for recognizing the importance of collaboration and community in achieving meaningful and impactful results.
