"Racial justice" refers to the goal of creating a society in which all individuals are treated fairly and equitably, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is the idea that all people should have equal access to opportunities and resources, and should be free from discrimination and prejudice based on their race.

Racial justice involves addressing the systemic and structural inequalities that exist in our society, and working to dismantle the systems and policies that perpetuate these inequalities. It requires recognizing and confronting the historical and ongoing impact of racism and discrimination on individuals and communities, and working towards creating more inclusive and equitable systems and institutions.

Racial justice is a complex and multifaceted issue that involves addressing not only individual attitudes and behaviors, but also institutional and systemic factors such as education, housing, healthcare, criminal justice, and employment. It requires a commitment to ongoing learning and dialogue, and a willingness to challenge and dismantle the status quo in order to create a more just and equitable society for all.
