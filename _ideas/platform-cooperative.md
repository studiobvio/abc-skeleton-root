The term "platform cooperative" refers to a specific type of cooperative that operates on a digital platform, such as a website or mobile app. Platform cooperatives are owned and governed by their users or members, who are often both producers and consumers of the platform's services.

In a platform cooperative, the users collectively own and control the platform, rather than a small group of investors or shareholders. This creates a more democratic and participatory platform, where users have a greater say in how the platform is run and what services are provided. Additionally, because the users are the owners of the platform, they share in the profits generated by the platform.

Platform cooperatives are important because they provide an alternative to traditional platform models, which often prioritize the interests of investors or shareholders over the needs of users. By placing ownership and control in the hands of users, platform cooperatives can prioritize the well-being and needs of their users, rather than just maximizing profits.

Platform cooperatives can have positive social and economic impacts, as well. By providing a platform for decentralized ownership and democratic control, they can empower communities and create more inclusive economies. They can also help to reduce economic inequality by providing a way for people to own and control the platforms they rely on, rather than being beholden to the interests of a small group of investors or shareholders.

Overall, platform cooperatives are a way to create more democratic and participatory digital platforms that prioritize the well-being and needs of their users. By providing an alternative to traditional platform models, they can help to create more inclusive and equitable economies.
