The term "spatial justice" refers to the idea that access to physical space and resources should be equitable and just for all members of society. This includes not only access to housing and public spaces, but also access to amenities like parks, transportation, and social services.

Spatial justice recognizes that access to physical space and resources is deeply connected to issues of social and economic inequality. It emphasizes the need for more equitable and inclusive societies that prioritize the well-being of all members of society, particularly those who have historically been marginalized and excluded.

One of the key principles of spatial justice is the idea that access to physical space and resources should not be determined solely by market forces, but should be guided by principles of equity and justice. This includes ensuring that affordable housing is available in all neighborhoods, that public transportation is accessible and affordable for all, and that public spaces are designed to be inclusive and welcoming to all members of society.

Spatial justice is particularly important in urban environments, where issues of inequality and exclusion are often concentrated. By promoting more equitable access to physical space and resources, spatial justice can help to create more inclusive and sustainable cities that prioritize the well-being of all members of society.

Overall, spatial justice is a concept that emphasizes the importance of equitable and just access to physical space and resources for all members of society. By prioritizing the needs of those who have historically been marginalized and excluded, spatial justice offers a path towards more inclusive and sustainable societies that work for everyone.
