"Futuring" is a concept that refers to the process of imagining and shaping the future. It's about thinking creatively and proactively about what the future might look like, and working to create a vision of the future that we want to live in.

When we "futurize," we're not just predicting what might happen in the future based on current trends and data. Instead, we're actively shaping the future by envisioning and working towards a more desirable and just future.

For example, if you're interested in environmentalism, you might "futurize" by imagining a future in which renewable energy is widely used, transportation is powered by clean energy, and there is no more pollution. You might work towards this vision by advocating for policies that support renewable energy, supporting companies that are committed to sustainability, and educating others about the importance of protecting the environment.

Futuring is important because it helps us to be proactive in shaping the future we want to live in, rather than simply reacting to what happens. By imagining and working towards a more desirable future, we can create a more just and equitable society for ourselves and future generations.
