"Transitioning" in the context of "transition design" refers to a process of systemic and transformative change. Transition design is an approach to design that focuses on creating solutions to complex social, environmental, and economic challenges, with the goal of facilitating a transition towards a more sustainable and just society.

When we talk about "transition" in this context, we're referring to the process of moving from our current unsustainable and unjust system to a more sustainable and just one. This process involves transforming our social, economic, and political systems, as well as our individual beliefs and behaviors.

For example, in the context of climate change, a "transition" might involve moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources. This would require changes in our energy infrastructure, transportation systems, and individual behavior, as well as changes in policy and regulation.

Transition design is important because it recognizes the need for systemic change in order to address complex social and environmental challenges. By focusing on creating solutions that facilitate a transition towards a more sustainable and just society, transition design aims to create lasting and transformative change. It encourages designers to work collaboratively with diverse stakeholders and to consider the broader social, economic, and environmental impacts of their designs.
