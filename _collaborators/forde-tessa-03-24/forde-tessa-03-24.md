Tessa Forde is an architectural practitioner, and a doctoral candidate and lecturer at Auckland University of Technology’s Huri Te Ao - School of Future Environments in Tāmaki Makaurau, Aotearoa New Zealand. Her interest in experimental education platforms and how they can disrupt and reimagine the discipline of architecture is at the centre of her research and has seen her co-organizing the Free School of Architecture in Los Angeles in 2018, establishing The Night School in Aotearoa, and involved with the Architecture Beyond Capitalism School for 2022 and 2023. This research work sits alongside her work in the profession across Aotearoa and Los Angeles and has culminated in the co-founding of a small practice who experiment with how architecture is practiced, who for, and how the architect's tools can be redeployed for a more aspirational, equitable, collective future.

In her free time Tessa likes the beach, writing, taking (usually blurry) photos on old film cameras and exploring new places.

Please get in touch if you would like to collaborate or share ideas about community building and architecture.
