I strive to leverage transdisciplinary tools and knowledge to empower and inspire communities (human and non-human) to cooperatively imagine and build a radically inclusive, equitable, resilient, and prosperous future. My research and work have taken many forms: web applications, data analysis/visualization, architectural designs, documentary films, science fiction stories, labor activism, policy proposals, video games, teaching, and parenting. I hope in the future there will be more.

With a diverse background in economics, geography, documentary media, architecture, urban planning, and data analytics, I work collaboratively with interdisciplinary teams to explore and deploy novel modes of understanding and evolving our shared environments, be they physical or digital, imaginary or real. We can do better.

My personal and collaborative work has been presented in the US and abroad at institutions including AIA Colorado, Colorado Chapter of the American Planning Association, Rocky Mountain Land Institute at the University of Denver, Pecha Kucha Denver, Yale School of Architecture Constructs Magazine, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, The Architectural Club - Chicago, The Isamu Noguchi Museum, UrbanOmnibus.net, and the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University.

Technical Expertise: Building Information Modelings (BIM, Revit), Computational Design (Dynamo, Grasshopper), Geographic Information Systems (GIS, QGIS), R Programming/Data Analysis/Data Visualization (R Tidyverse), Interactive Data Visualization (Power BI, Shiny Apps).
