  <h1>The Architecture Beyond Capitalism (ABC) Hub</h1>
  <p>
    The ABC Hub welcomes those with interests in and ideas for—however small,
    however fantastical—working out what it means to learn and practice
    architecture more collectively, more ethically and more sustainably. <br />
    Through collective participation the ABC Hub holds space to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>find global allies for change-making projects and movements.</li>
    <li>
      test frameworks, formats and strategies for building better and lasting
      collective momentum;
    </li>
    <li>
      layout visions for architecture beyond capitalism—including alternatives
      and improvements to the status quo;
    </li>
    <li>
      develop disciplinary language and practices that are more open and
      inclusive;
    </li>
    <li>humanize the expectations and outcomes of design processes;</li>
    <li>explore and develop together in a messy process</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This space is free, inclusive, supportive and open to all: students,
    educators, practitioners, constructors, and anyone interested in or
    passionate about affecting change. We invite individuals and collectives
    working to affect change in spatial production; individuals and collectives
    working with people, groups, communities or organisations to bring about an
    equitable tomorrow; individuals or collectives working with new
    organizational techniques for leveraging influence. We would like to learn
    from the experiences of others meeting this challenge, and foster a space to
    support those just starting out.
